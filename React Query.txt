React Query 

A library for fetching data in React Application 

Why ? 
1 . Since React is a UI library , there is no specific pattern for data fetching 
2. useEffect hook for data fetching and usestate hook to maintain component state like loading , error or resulted data 
3. If hte data is needed throughout the app , we tend to use state management libraries 

4. Most of the state management libraries are good for working with client state .

5 . State management libraries are not great for working with asynchronous or server state 

Client vs Server state 

Client State 
- Persisted in your app memory and accessing or updating it synchronously 

Server state 
- Persisted remotely and requires asynchronous APIs for fetching or updating 
- Has shared ownership 
- Data can be updated by someone else without your knowledge 
- UI data may not be in sync  with  remote data 
- Challenging when you have to deal with caching , deduping multiple request for the same data  , updating stale data in the background , performance optimizations etc 




Project Setup 
1. New React Project using CRA 
2. set up an API endpoint that serves mock data for use in our application 
3. Set  up react router and a few routes in that application 
4. Fetch data the traditional way using useEffect and useState   

JSON-SERVER Libaray 
1. install library json-server 
2. in package json add this in script 

"scripts":{
  "serve-json": "json-server --watch db.json --port 4000"
}

3.  create db.josn file put data , you wil be able to see
